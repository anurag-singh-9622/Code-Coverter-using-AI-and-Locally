Code to Code Converter
The Code to Code Converter is a tool that translates code from one programming language to another using powerful language models. It utilizes the OpenAI API for language model processing or can be run locally using a hosted LLM server via the LMStudio application.

Features
Convert code between multiple programming languages.
Supports a wide range of programming languages.
Option to use OpenAI API or a locally hosted LLM server.
Easy to set up and use.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To use this tool, you need:

An OpenAI API key (if you choose to use OpenAI's models).
Alternatively, you can set up a locally hosted LLM server using the LMStudio application.
Setup
Option 1: Using OpenAI API
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-to-code-converter.git
cd code-to-code-converter
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Option 2: Using LMStudio for Local LLM Server
Download and install the LMStudio application from LMStudio's official website.

Set up the LLM server following the instructions provided by LMStudio.

Update the configuration file (config.json) in the repository to point to your locally hosted LLM server:

json
Copy code
{
    "llm_server": "http://localhost:5000"
}
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
The tool provides a simple command-line interface to convert code. You can specify the source language, target language, and the code you want to convert.

Example:

bash
Copy code
python main.py --source_language "Python" --target_language "JavaScript" --code "print('Hello World')"
The output will display the converted code in the target language.

Supported Languages
The Code to Code Converter currently supports the following programming languages:

Python
JavaScript
